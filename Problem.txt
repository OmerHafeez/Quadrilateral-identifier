 A shape with four vertices and sides is known as a quadrilateral. Square, rectangle,
kite, rhombus, trapezium, and parallelogram are all quadrilaterals. Write a C++ program for
guessing the type of the quadrilateral. Your program should guess correctly, in case of incorrect
input, display appropriate message. Phrase all questions in a way that user must enter some boolean
value Y/N as an answer. Both Y/y are treated as ‘Yes’.
Example:
Think of a quadrilateral from square, rectangle, kite, rhombus, trapezium and parallelogram and I
will guess it....
Let’s start
[Optional: you can place counter here like display 3, 2, 1....]
Q1. Are all sides equal? (Y or N) Y
Q2. Are all angles 90 degrees? (Y or N) Y
I got it! It’s a SQUARE.
